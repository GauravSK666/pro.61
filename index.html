        <p id="para">One can use cycle as an exercise instrument or a vehicle. Thus, the pleasures included in cycling depend on the purpose. Irrespective of the purpose, there are some common pleasures such as feels of fresh air, newer scenes, relaxation of mind etc.

            When we travel around using cycle, we feel the fresh air which is absent in case of traveling in a car. We can see the outside life more closely. We become sentimental towards the social life. We completely overlook the resentment of life when we move on the cycle. Those who live into the populated cities can enjoy cycling more than those who belong to the village.</p>

        <p id="p1">Bicycles were introduced in the 19th century and now number approximately one billion worldwide.[5] They are the principal means of transportation in many parts of the world.

            Cycling is widely regarded as an effective and efficient mode of transportation[6][7] optimal for short to moderate distances.

            Bicycles provide numerous possible benefits in comparison with motor vehicles, including the sustained physical exercise involved in cycling, easier parking, increased maneuverability, and access to roads, bike paths and rural trails. Cycling also offers a reduced consumption of fossil fuels, less air or noise pollution, reduced greenhouse gas emissions,[8] and greatly reduced traffic congestion.[9] These have a lower financial cost for users as well as for society at large (negligible damage to roads, less road area required). By fitting bicycle racks on the front of buses, transit agencies can significantly increase the areas they can serve.[10]

            In addition, cycling provides a variety of health benefits. The World Health Organization (WHO) states that cycling can reduce the risk of cancers, heart disease, and diabetes that are prevalent in sedentary lifestyles.[11][12] Cycling on stationary bikes have also been used as part of rehabilitation for lower limb injuries, particularly after hip surgery.[13] Individuals who cycle regularly have also reported mental health improvements, including less perceived stress and better vitality.[14]

            Among the disadvantages of cycling are the requirement of bicycles (excepting tricycles or quadricycles) to be balanced by the rider in order to remain upright, the reduced protection in crashes in comparison to motor vehicles,[15] often longer travel time (except in densely populated areas), vulnerability to weather conditions, difficulty in transporting passengers, and the fact that a basic level of fitness is required for cycling moderate to long distances.</p>
